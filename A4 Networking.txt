"Given these requirements
Base address: 142.150.235.0
Network mask: 255.255.255.224
Broadcast address: 142.150.235.31
Reserved Router address: 142.150.235.1
a) What is the address of the assigned subnetwork and what is the extended network prefix?
b) Which IP addresses can I use to configure the computers in my lab?
c) Suppose I wanted to subdivide the assigned address block into 4 smaller subnetworks of equal size. How large are these networks, and how many IP addresses can I assign in each subnetwork?

ANSWERS 
A)  1)The Extended Network Prefix is : /27
      2) Address of Subnetwork will be same as Base Address that is                      
          142.150.235.0/27
B) The IP Addresses you can use to configure in your lab are ranging from
              142.150.235.2/27   to     142.150.235.30/27
        Including the Network Address and BroadCast and Reserved IP we have total   
        32 Addresses.
C) NOW, Dividing into 4 smaller subnetworks of equal size :
   1) These networks will range from 
           1.1) 142.150.235.0/30  to   142.150.235.7/30 
            1.2)   142.150.235.8/30  to   142.150.235.15/30 
            1.3)   142.150.235.16/30  to   142.150.235.23/30 
            1.4)   142.150.235.24/30  to   142.150.235.31/30 
  2) In each network you can Assign 6 IP's as 1st and Last IP's are assigned 
       to Network Address and Broadcast Address.
